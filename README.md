# Dataset
​
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) was created by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to receive reports about adverse events that may be associated with vaccines. No prescription drug or biological product, such as a vaccine, is completely free from side effects. Vaccines protect many people from dangerous illnesses, but vaccines, like drugs, can cause side effects, a small percentage of which may be serious. VAERS is used to continually monitor reports to determine whether any vaccine or vaccine lot has a higher than expected rate of events.

# Objective
​
For this project, I will be working to draw conclusions about statistical significance of deaths ossociated with both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines on average, assuming that all the reported deaths of VAERS are due to Covid19. 

VAERS dataset represents our sample of the entire population. 

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.
